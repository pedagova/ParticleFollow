Now, lets explain it.

The idea of this proyect is:

  1ยบ create a 2D world where place all the entities from our world and giving to then some behaviour.
  
  2ยบ create a new scenario 3D where move the particles
  
  3ยบ modify the player and particle behaviour to adapt it to 3D enviroment
  
  4ยบ create some cooler "face" (animations and stuff), for this create the animator resource.
  
  
  Special thx to SiffMan for his youtube tutorials, thaks to this I learn processing enought to get started, and i create this proyect to practice.
